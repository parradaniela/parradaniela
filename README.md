### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniela!

I'm a front-end developer focusing on JavaScript and React to design responsive, accessible web apps. Welcome to my Github page! I recently graduated from Juno College of Technology's Web Development Bootcamp and am excited to continue on my developer journey. 

Iâ€™m currently working on updating my bootcamp projects to implement some of the things I learned after submitting them! Once the revisions are done, I will be delving into converting a PSD design into a mobile-first design, and creating more ReactJS projects to continue deepening my knowledge and understanding. 

Please do feel free to visit my portfolio https://danielaparra.com/ for some more info about me and my projects!
