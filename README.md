### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniela!

I'm a front-end developer focusing on JavaScript and React to design responsive, accessible web apps. Welcome to my Github page! I'm a graduate from Juno College of Technology's Web Development Bootcamp and am excited to continue on my developer journey. 

Iâ€™m currently working on updating my older projects. Once the revisions are done, I will be delving into converting a PSD design into a mobile-first design, and creating more complex ReactJS projects. 

Please do feel free to visit my portfolio https://danielaparra.com/ for some more info about me and my projects!
