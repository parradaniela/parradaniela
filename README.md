### Hi there 👋 I'm Daniela!

I'm a front-end developer specializing in React to design responsive, accessible web apps. Welcome to my Github page! I'm a graduate from Juno College of Technology's Web Development Bootcamp and am excited to continue on my developer journey. 

I recently started to integrate TypeScript into my React applications, and am in the process of creating an e-commerce site from a mockup to add to my project showcase. Looking ahead into the future, I want to add Nextjs and Nodejs to my tech stack so I can go on to build even more complex apps 👩‍💻
